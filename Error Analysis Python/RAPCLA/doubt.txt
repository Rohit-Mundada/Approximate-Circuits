In this paper, "Probabilistic Error Modeling for
Approximate Adders", they have taken number of sum and prediction bits for each subadder and calculated the internal probabilities for each inclusion exclusion term.

But in your paper, you have a separate carry generator block and sub-adder block. So all of the bits in the sub-adder are taken as the final sum ?

If that is the case then these both configurations are not same.

Or if they are same, then are the prediction bits inside a sub-adder = carry generator block length?
